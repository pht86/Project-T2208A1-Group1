                <p><b>Equipment:</b> gym shoes (sneakers), jump rope</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Jumping rope helps develop better body awareness, hand-foot coordination, and
                    agility.</p>
                <p><b>Safety:</b> Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height. Stand with both feet on the middle
                    of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits. That’s the height you’re going for. If it’s too
                    long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope.</p>
                <p><b>Duration and frequency:</b> 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week</p>

                <p>Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure
                    you have plenty of space. Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete.</p>
                <p>If you’re a beginner:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet. Do this
                        move for 15 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope. Do this
                        move for 15 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Finish your set by doing a hopscotch jump for 15 seconds. To do this move, jump rope in place,
                        and as you jump, alternate between jumping your feet out to the sides and then back to the
                        center, similar to how you’d move them while doing jumping jacks. Do this move for 15 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rest for 15 seconds between sets.</li>
                    <li>Repeat 18 times.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you’re an intermediate exerciser, you can perform the moves for 30 seconds and rest for 30 seconds
                    between sets. The advanced circuit should be performed for 60 seconds at a time, followed by 60
                    seconds of rest.</p>

                <p>If walking is your main form of exercise, aim to get 150 minutes per week. This can be broken down
                    into 30 minutes of walking 5 days a week. Or, walk briskly for 10 minutes at a time, 3 times each
                    day.</p>
                <p>You can also use a fitness tracker to keep tabs on how many steps you take each day. If your goal is
                    to walk 10,000 steps a day, start with your base (current amount you walk) and slowly up your daily
                    step count. You can do this by increasing your daily steps by an extra 500 to 1,000 steps a day
                    every 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
                <p>So, once you’ve identified your base, add an extra 500 to 1,000 steps. Then, 1 to 2 weeks later,
                    increase your daily step count by an additional 500 to 1,000 steps.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Swimming</h2>
                <p><b>Equipment:</b> pool, swimsuit, goggles (optional)</p>
                <p><b>Benefits:</b> Swimming is a low impact exercise, so it’s good for people prone to or recovering
                    from an injury or living with limited mobility. It can help you tone your muscles and build strength
                    and endurance.</p>
                <p><b>Safety:</b> Avoid swimming alone and, if possible, choose a pool with a lifeguard on duty. If
                    you’re new to swimming, begin by enrolling in swim lessons.</p>
                <p><b>Duration and frequency:</b> 10 to 30 minutes, 2 to 5 times a week. Add 5 minutes to your swim time
                    each week to increase your duration.</p>
                <p>If your gym has a pool, try swimming as aerobic exercise. It’s a low impact workout, so it’s a good
                    choice if you’re prone to injury. You’re also increasing your heart rate, toning your muscles, and
                    building strength and endurance — all without adding additional strain to your body.</p>

                    height. This will help reduce your risk of injury or falling off the bike.</p>
                <p>If biking at home, a general rule is to adjust the bike seat height to maintain a 5- to 10-degree
                    bend (slight bend) in your knee before reaching full extension. Doing so reduces compression on your
                    knee joint. It’s not recommended to fully extend your knee while peddling on a stationary bike.</p>

                <p>Riding a stationary bike is another option for low impact cardio. Stationary bikes are a good
                    cardiovascular workout, help you develop leg strength, and are easy to use. Many gyms and workout
                    studios offer cycling classes, which use stationary bikes. But you can still benefit from a
                    stationary bike workout without taking a class.</p>
                <p>After stretching and warming up by cycling at an easy rhythm for 5 to 10 minutes, increase your pace
                    to 75 to 80 rotations per minute (RPM) and aim for 20 to 30 minutes of steady cycling. Cool down for
                    5 minutes. Stretch to finish.</p>
                <p>Keep enough resistance on the bike to feel like you’re pushing the pedals instead of feeling like the
                    pedals are pushing your feet. Increase the resistance for a more challenging workout.</p>

                <p>The elliptical machine may seem intimidating at first, but it’s easy to use once you get the hang of
                    it. After warming up at an easy rhythm for 5 to 10 minutes, keep your posture upright while you use
                    your legs in a pedal motion to move the machine.</p>

                <p>When we’re looking to level up our sports skills or striving to beat our last race times, there are physical training exercises to increase stamina and improve our strength and speed. Practicing them regularly will make us better at our sports, our pastimes — and at enjoying life. Similarly, there are many benefits to adding meditation and mindfulness exercises into our daily or weekly routine.</p>
                <p>Meditation is, after all, simply an exercise to cultivate mindfulness. The more time we spend sitting with the mind, the more at ease we feel within ourselves. And, as we do weightlifting exercises to develop our biceps or quads, there are meditation exercises we can do throughout the day to strengthen our “mindfulness muscle.” The more awareness we can bring to our day, the greater calm, clarity, and contentment we’ll feel. For beginners or anyone fairly new to meditating, guided mindfulness exercises are a good option as they provide instruction, encouragement, and support.</p>

                <p>To calm your nerves Maybe you’re prepping for a big presentation at work and feeling a little anxious. Or a co-worker is getting under your skin. Try this 1-minute deep breathing exercise to sharpen your cognitive function and reduce symptoms of anxiet.</p>
                <p>Sitting comfortably in a chair, take a big, deep breath. As you breathe in, notice how the body expands; as you breathe out, feel the body soften. Gently close the eyes. Rather than the mind leading the breath, allow the breath to lead the mind. Notice the sensation of the breath, and where you feel it in the body. Follow that rising and falling sensation, allowing thoughts to come and go. When you’re ready, gently open the eyes.</p>
                <p>Before a workout Warm up your body and mind with this 1-minute meditation exercise.</p>
                <p>Sitting down, take a nice deep breath, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Feel the mind in the body more present, more aware, more focused. Notice how the body feels, whether there’s a sense of energy or lightness, heaviness or discomfort. (Incorporating mindfulness into your fitness training will put you in good company: U.S. Soccer and Major League Soccer signed partnerships with Headspace to strengthen their athletes’ and coaches’ mindfulness skills!)</p>

                <p>In the shower A daily shower is the perfect time to practice your mindfulness meditation exercises. (The length of your shower is unimportant. Just make sure to leave your phone in another room, so it won’t disturb you.)</p>
                <p>As you step into the shower, be aware of how the water feels as it hits your head, your back, your arms. Is it hot enough? Too hot? Notice which part of the body you wash first, then switch it up. Habits like showering usually put us on autopilot: we go through the motions while the mind skips off. If your thoughts have wandered, gently bring your attention back to the present. You can apply this mindfulness exercise to just about any daily habit, from pouring yourself a glass of iced tea, to brushing your teeth, to taking a walk.</p>
                <p>Before a meal Whether you’re sharing a meal or eating alone, you’re probably looking forward to the first bite of whatever is on your plate! Before digging in, take a minute for this one-minute mindful eating exercise.</p>
                <p>Pause to bring your attention to the food. Think about where your food has come from, where it was grown, how it was prepared. In our fast-paced lives, we often miss that farm-to-table connection. Engage the physical senses — the sight, the texture, the aroma of the food. Does it take you to a particular place in your mind? As you begin to eat, don’t wolf down your meal! Chew it slowly, savoring the complexity of flavors, and each moment.</p>

                <p>Improve your relationships Visualization exercises may seem daunting at first, but any difficulties usually have more to do with our approach, our worry that we’re not doing it “right,” than with the technique itself. Essentially, we’re just replacing the breath with a mental image. And when our mind wanders off or we get distracted by a thought or feeling, we gently bring our attention back to that image. So don’t overthink it!</p>
                <p>This visualization exercise helps create conditions in the mind for happier, healthier relationships.</p>
                <p>Start by sitting comfortably, and taking a few deep breaths in through the nose, and out through the mouth. After a few breaths, gently close eyes and allow the breath to return to its natural rhythm. Once you’re settled in, scan down the body from head to toe, getting a sense of how the body feels, the underlying mood. Be clear about your intention for doing this exercise, and how by doing it you can potentially improve the lives of those around you. Rest the mind on wherever you feel the rise and fall of the breath most strongly.</p>
                <p>Imagine now a pinprick of light, like a speck of sunlight, in the middle of the body. At the same time, remember a time when you’ve done something or said something to another person that’s really been appreciated. Remember how that person looked, or what they said, and be reminded of that feeling, which was the result of an act of kindness. As you recall the feeling, that speck of sunlight begins expanding in the body, moving outward in every direction, filling the body with qualities of warmth, light, and spaciousness.</p>
                <p>Gently let go of the act of kindness and just be present with that visualization, as if it’s happening on its own, and you’re just watching it in the mind as it happens — watching the spacious, warm, bright awareness expanding. When it feels like it’s reached every part of the body, let go of the image, and just allow the mind rest in that space, and do whatever it wants to do, for about 10 seconds. Then gently bring the attention back to the physical space around you. Open the eyes, pausing to appreciate the feeling.</p>
                <p>Feel more balanced This visualization exercise can help you feel more centered, more grounded, and bring you back to that place when you’re feeling overwhelmed. For this one, you’ll imagine a steady stream of “liquid sunlight” flowing down from the top of the head with all the qualities you’d imagine summer sunlight to have: warmth, spaciousness, clarity. (Remember, don’t overthink it!)</p>
                <p>Start by sitting comfortably and taking a few deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Gently close the eyes and feel the weight of the body in the chair, settling in to physical senses. Scan down through the body, noticing how the body feels. Is there a sense of balance or imbalance? Are you a little tense or tight? Rest the mind on the feeling of the breath.</p>
